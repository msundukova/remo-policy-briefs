## remo-policy-briefs
Policy briefs for different countries
* _national background brief_ - is a relatively short document, collecting the background evidence on a specific topic for a particular country.
* _policy brief_ - is a brief "kind of report" document, written for non-expert audience, containing evidence AND recommendations for policy, in comparison to the national backgroud brief it is action-oriented.



ReMO COST actions
Researcher Mental Health Observatory

Dr. Mayya Sundukova holds a _virtual mobility grant_ from the ReMO COST actions with following goals:
* to develop the template for writing national background briefs - how is the situation with mental health of researchers in the academic sector in different countries, which interventions and policies exist and how is it poossibly linked with the structure of academic system-career-funding in this particular country
* to coordinate writing the country/ policy briefs by and with the ReMO network participants and beyond
